# Hello Dioco

Hi Dioco, I work for a small company with the same name as you :) We make this Chrome extension for learning languages: https://extension.dioco.io/.

We'd like to create an organization account on GitHub using our name (Dioco), but you have the name already. It looks like you haven't done anything in this account since you opened it 8 years ago. Would you mind contacting us to see if we can have this account on GitHub? I tried to contact GitHub, but they wouldn't help :(

Our email is dioco@dioco.io. I look forward to hearing from you, and thanks in advance for your time!

Best,
Nathan
